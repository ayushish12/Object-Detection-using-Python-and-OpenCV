# Object-Detection-using-Python-and-OpenCV
The main objective of this project is to identify cars and pedestrians, using Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning Algorithms. After acquisition of series of images, cars and pedestrians are detected using Haar Cascade Classifier. The model for the classifier is trained using lots of images to make an XML file.  It demonstrates the flexibility of a tracking system adapted to a moving camera, which is ideal for automotive safety applications. 
REQUIRED TOOLS:
-	Visual Studio Code
-	Open CV (which is an open source computer vision library)
-	Python
-	Haar Cascade (which is a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects in an image or video) 
-	XML
